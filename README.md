## Remaining Tasks
#### Network Security Laboratory Development:

- Develop and integrate current, hands-on network security labs to reflect the latest industry threats and best practices.
#### Monitoring Infrastructure Enhancements:

1. **Containerization:** Package data gathering and analysis tools into Docker containers for standardized and portable deployment.
2. **Orchestration:** Leverage Kubernetes to orchestrate and manage the containerized monitoring services, enhancing scalability and resilience.
3. **Intrusion Detection:** Deploy a network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to analyze traffic and identify potential threats prior to reaching the server endpoint.
4. **Firewall Implementation:** Deploy and configure a firewall, establishing a comprehensive rule set to enforce access control policies and protect the network perimeter.
5. **Targeted Traffic Analysis:** Configure port mirroring (SPAN) on the network switch to isolate and monitor inbound traffic from external sources, filtering out non-relevant network segments.
